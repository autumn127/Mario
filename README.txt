Use the directional pad to move Luigi.
Tap the A button to jump.
Hold down the B button to run, and tap to fire a fireball if you have collected a Fire Flower (Running does not work well on emulator :( ).
All enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or hitting them with a fireball.
Hammer Bros. (the green enemies) and Fire Bros. (the red enemies) can also be defeated by destroying the ground beneath them.
Hit the yellow question blocks from below to make an item spawn.
Reaching the flagpole at the end of a level will start the next level.
There are only three levels, and they will cycle after the third one is completed.
When the player runs out of lives (as shown in the top left of the screen), the game is restarted from level 1 with the score reset.
